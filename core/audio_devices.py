"""
core/audio_devices.py — pick which microphone and which speakers Neeraj uses.

WHY
    Both audio streams in main.py were opened without a `device=` argument, so
    they always took whatever the operating system called "default". On a laptop
    with a built-in mic, a webcam mic and a headset that is a coin toss — and on
    Windows the default *moves on its own* the moment you plug a headset in.
    "Neeraj can't hear me" almost always means "Neeraj is listening to the
    monitor's microphone".

WHY NAMES, NOT INDICES
    sounddevice identifies devices by integer index, and those indices shift
    whenever a device appears or disappears. Storing index 3 means that after
    unplugging a USB interface the saved setting silently points at something
    else. We store the device *name* and resolve it to an index at open time.

WHY THIS IS CACHED
    `sd.query_devices()` talks to the host audio API and can take a few hundred
    milliseconds on a Windows machine with many endpoints. Mark LV learned this
    lesson the expensive way — a 2.1-second `openwakeword` import on the Qt
    thread made the settings drawer look like it was broken. So the list is
    fetched once on a background thread at startup and served from cache.
